<pre><code>text-transform: capitalize | uppercase | lowercase | none | inherit</code></pre>

<p><code>capitalize</code> might work in some scenarios for acronymns and logograms like Unesco (not <span class="caps">UNESCO</span>) and Wordperfect (not WordPerfect). But it won't help with laser (not Laser or <span class="caps">LASER</span>) or radar (not Radar or <span class="caps">RADAR</span>). The text will probably have to be edited to produce the preferred capitalization in each case.</p>
